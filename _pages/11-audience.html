  <h1>Knowing your audience makes all the difference.</h1>
  <p>To engage with your audience is to know your audience. Know them in a way that you “get” them. You understand them. You can relate to them, and you know what’s important to them, what makes them take notice, and what will make them take action. That’s the difference between being successful and being memorable. And who doesn’t want to be remembered?</p>
  <p>So, let’s get to know your audience a little better, shall we?</p>
